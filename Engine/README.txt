Stuff to add:

bitmap:
support different bmp formats
scaling of Text
kleinbuchstaben und satzzeichen
INCLUDE SPACE!   ---  currently done in GetLetterWidth

Menu:
	menu::label:
	add a "Style" Object for rounded corners and all that fancy stuff
make a checkbox-type button
make a slider-type button

General:
maybe even just predefine some options in the optionsmenu
then i dont need to make the slider but just buttons, size: small, medium, big, done
it however is the cheap way out:
- then again to complex optionsmenu might be bad design for the game
- but its not actually about the game but to show my ability to program
	- could argue that that is a skill aswell, then again...
